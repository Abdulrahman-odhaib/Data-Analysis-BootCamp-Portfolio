# Analyzing-data-on-Nobel-Prize-winners

**The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since
1901. Prizes are awarded annually in the fields of chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine,
economics and peace. In addition to honour, prestige and a significant amount of prize money, the award
recipient also receives a gold medal bearing the image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who founded the
award. The Nobel Foundation has made available a dataset of all laureates from the awards' inception, 1901
to 2023.**

Note: This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Nobel Prize winners' data. The script uses pandas and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

**"We will analyze the History of Nobel Prize Winners, and answer some questions"**

*1. What is the most awarded gender and birth_country? Save your answers as top_gender and 
top_country.*

*2. Rearrange the data by decade (1900-1910-1920 ..etc). Which year has the highest rate of US-born 
winners? Store this as an integer called max_decade_usa.*

*3. Rearrange the data by decade (1900-1910-1920 ..etc). Which decade and category pair had the 
highest proportion of female award winners? Store this as a dictionary called max_female_dict, 
where decade is key and category is value.*

*4. Who is the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and in what category did she receive this award? 
Save your answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.*
