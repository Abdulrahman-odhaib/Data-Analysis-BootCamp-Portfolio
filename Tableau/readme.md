## About the Dataset

### Context
This dataset provides an in-depth look into various aspects of human resources management within an organization. It includes employee details, job roles, departments, salaries, and other key HR metrics that can be used to analyze workforce trends and performance.

### Content
The dataset includes the following key features:
- **Employee Information**: ID, name, age, gender, marital status, and other demographic details.
- **Job Roles and Departments**: Employee job titles, department assignments, and job levels.
- **Compensation**: Salary details, bonus structures, and other financial metrics.
- **Performance**: Employee performance ratings, promotions, and tenure.
- **Attendance and Leaves**: Records of attendance, leaves, and absences.

### Inspiration
Here are some questions that this dataset could help answer:
- What are the most common job roles within the organization?
- How does salary distribution vary across different departments?
- What trends can be observed in employee performance ratings over time?
- Is there a correlation between employee tenure and performance?
